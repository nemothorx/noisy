# Be (pleasantly) noisy

This script uses sox (invoked as "play") to simulate various soothing ambient
sounds via synthesising noise and manipulating it

# Thanks to
Original idea from http://unreasonable.org/white_noise_generator_with_sox_for_Linux

Further discussed on facebook and IRC in 2016, and expanded again 2023

# Issues

* Only minimal effort has been made to make the various sound themes consistent
  in invocation options or style - and most important as an issue: volume
* Many themes throw WARNs to stderr
* Many themes have an unpleasant audio glitch at start
