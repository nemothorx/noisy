# Be noisy

But pleasantly

This script uses sox (invoked as "play") to simulate various soothing ambient sounds via synthesising noise and manipulating it

Original idea from http://unreasonable.org/white_noise_generator_with_sox_for_Linux

Further discussed on facebook and IRC in 2016, and expanded again 2023
