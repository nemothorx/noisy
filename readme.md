# Be (pleasantly) noisy

This script uses sox (invoked as "play") to simulate various soothing ambient
sounds via synthesising noise and manipulating it


# Thanks to

Original idea from https://unreasonable.org/white_noise_generator_with_sox_for_Linux - and definitely worth visiting for more ideas in the comments

Also discussed on fb and IRC in 2016, and revisited again 2023

Notable thanks to IRC's Neale and Paul


# Issues

* Only minimal effort has been made to make the various sound themes consistent
  in invocation options or style - and most important as an issue: volume
* Many themes throw WARNs to stderr
* Many themes have an unpleasant audio glitch at start
